        "*   There were no missing values in the dataset.\n",

        "*   Topic modeling using TF-IDF and LDA with 10 topics was applied to the processed text.\n",
        "*   Based solely on the top 10 words per topic, most topics were dominated by general conversational terms, internet slang, or platform-specific discussions.\n",
        "*   Topic 8, containing words like 'feel', 'life', 'want', 'dont', and 'friend', and potentially Topic 10, with the word 'scaredi', were identified as having the most potential relevance to discussions about personal feelings, struggles, or fears related to mental health, although this link is not definitive based on top words alone.\n",

        "*   Given the ethical implications, any application of a model trained on this data for mental health detection must be approached with extreme caution, transparency, and ideally involve clinical oversight, prioritizing user privacy and preventing misuse.\n"
