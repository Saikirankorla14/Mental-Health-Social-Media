# Mental-Health-Social-Media

üìå Project Overview
This project explores the detection of signs of depression or anxiety from social media posts. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the goal is to identify patterns, topics, and linguistic signals associated with mental health struggles. The project uses the Reddit Mental Health Dataset, with careful consideration of ethical implications.
üéØ Goal
To build an NLP-based system capable of detecting potential signs of depression or anxiety from user-generated text on social media platforms. The focus is not only on predictive performance but also on ensuring ethical use and avoiding harmful misinterpretation.
üìÇ Dataset
Dataset: Reddit Mental Health Dataset

The dataset contains posts from Reddit communities where individuals discuss their mental health. It is crucial to handle this dataset with sensitivity, anonymization, and strict ethical guidelines.

Important Considerations:
- Do not attempt to diagnose individuals.
- Use only for research and educational purposes.
- Ensure anonymization of personally identifiable information (PII).
üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Techniques
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text preprocessing, tokenization, embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT).
- **Topic Modeling:** LDA, BERTopic for uncovering underlying discussion themes.
- **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Transformers for text classification.
- **Ethical AI:** Bias mitigation, responsible communication of results, and privacy preservation.
üìå Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing (clean text, remove sensitive details).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (word frequencies, sentiment analysis).
3. Topic Modeling (LDA/BERTopic for theme extraction).
4. Model Training (multi-class or binary classification for mental health indicators).
5. Model Evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score to minimize false positives).
6. Interpretability (SHAP, attention weights).
7. Ethical Review (ensure compliance with mental health research guidelines).
‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations
- This project is not intended for clinical diagnosis.
- Predictions should be interpreted cautiously.
- Ensure user anonymity and data protection.
- Results must not be used to stigmatize individuals.
- Collaborate with mental health professionals for validation.
‚úÖ Expected Outcomes
- An NLP pipeline for analyzing mental health-related text.
- Topic models highlighting key themes in mental health discussions.
- A responsible classification model with focus on precision and recall.
- Ethical guidelines for applying AI to mental health contexts.
